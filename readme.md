# Dot Config Files

Designed to help me get up and running as quickly as possible on a new system since I like a fresh start every now and again. Batch and shell scripting is a bit frustrating and fragile to me, so as a result I like to use python

## Usage

An install python script is supplied 

```bash
# Interactive install, it will ask you want you want
$ python _install.py

# Select a specific folder/program you want to config
$ python _install.py [options] --install=folder1,folder2
```

#
