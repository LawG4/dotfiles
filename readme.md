# Dot Config Files

Designed to help me get up and running as quickly as possible on a new system since I like a fresh start every now and again. We wanna split things into phases. 

## 1. Bootstrap to nu

Generally I dislike `.sh`/`.bat` scripting, so we bootstrap out of those as quickly as possible. So the first thing we do is go into nushell so we can ditch those as quickly as possible. 

Even if you don't like nushell as your final shell, we can use just for running the scripts 

```bash
# On Unix which comes with sh
bootstrap.sh

# On windows, batch script sadge
bootstrap.bat
```
